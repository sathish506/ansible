# ansible

Ansible is a configuration management tool which works both on push and pull mechanisms

### INVENTORY File
 Inventory is nothing but the list of machine ip or dns names that you want ansible to be managed.
Ansible by default installs 2.9 as by default on AMI's we will get python2. Always go with latest version, which can be installed from tools/ansible/install.sh

all is a group which included all the entries in INVENTORY File.

Ansible is all about MODULES ( Collections )
